## Overview

The word **Jäger** means **Hunter** in German.

The goal of Jäger was to create a job hunting dashboard where I could keep a history of all jobs applied for throughout my time as a developer. When you're applying for jobs and scheduling interviews it can be hard to remember who you're talking to, the name of the company, etc. so I wanted to solve this issue for myself.
